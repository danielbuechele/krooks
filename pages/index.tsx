        <p>
          Krooks are a collection of 1131 randomly generated NFT’s that exist on
          the Solana Blockchain. The Krooks are not only focused on being one of
          the coolest PFP projects in sol, but have a focus to help holders who
          have been the victims of rugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Krook holders will are able to participate in exclusive events hosted
          for the benefit such as the Rugsino, exclusive NFT mints, community
          giveaways, access to the Krook Coin, and much more.

              We will be airdropping 10 KROOK per unlisted KROOK daily. This
              will begin on December 3rd. During the first week leading up to
              our first auction we will be doing bonus drops to rewards holders.
              During the first week leading up to our first auction we will be
              doing bonus drops like we did this morning in order to increase
              liquidity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we will burn 80-90% of krook turned into the rugsino and
              or auction nfts, the remainder will be used to further develop the
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 10% staff allocation will be rolled out in stages over the
              next two years. 0.41% of total pool will be sent to stay per
              month.

          <p>
            Krook Coin is a utility token created to support the Krookverse. The
            token will be used for bidding and obtaining Krook Specific NFT’s
            such as banners, lore based NFT’s and some 1/1 legendaries!
          </p>
        </Box>
        <Box title="Henchmen">
          <p>
            By holding a minimum of 2 Krooks, you can pay a fee in Krook Coins
            to hire a young henchman. These henchmen will travel around the
            Krookverse and collect Krook Coin debts. There will be a limited
            supply of Henchmen and they will be crucial to earning some future
            rewards!

        <h3>Henchmen Dynamics</h3>
        <h3>Governance</h3>
        <p>
          Krook Coins will also be utilized as a tool for community voting,
          while we will not be setting up the typical DAO users have become
          accustomed too, we still want to have an active community driven
          experience.

        </hgroup>

        <div className={styles.faqBox}>
          <h4>Wen Mint?</h4>
          <p>
            We are minting sometime between the 26th and 27th of November, after
            thanksgiving to allow people to spend time with their families and
            attend to the holidays. IRL &gt; NFT
          </p>
          <h4>Supply?</h4>
          <p>
            1111 Krooks, with around 20 or so for giveaways and project
            development.
          </p>
          <h4>Price?</h4>
          <p>
            TBD. We want to come to a fair price for both the team and our
            minters. We want to provide a low entry price into our project and
            leave room for upside on secondary.
          </p>
          <h4>Roadmap?</h4>
          <p>
            We have a few ideas cooking now. We do not want to overpromise, but
            we also understand that just offering a PFPis not the most appealing
            aspect to mintoooors.
          </p>
          <h4>Who are we?</h4>
          <p>
            We have been on dev teams, advisory teams, DAOteams, or mods for
            other projects on Solana. We have also been around since august of
            2021. Some of our first mints include SMB, Thugbirdz, PiggysolGang,
            Sollamas and others. So we have been around.
          </p>
          <h4>What’s our goal?</h4>
          <p>
            To build a small strong community where you can come and be
            yourself. We understand that many other projects have been around
            longer than us and have high entry costs. We want to build something
            with you, and give you a chance to be early.
